# Understand the IELTS Speaking

The Speaking test takes __between 11 and 14 minutes__ and consists of an interview between the test taker and a trained and certified examiner.

## Before Your Speaking Test

- You'll be given a day and time for your speaking test

```
              -----------------------------
                      Speaking Test
                Candidate Number: abc123
                     Friday, 3.10pm
              -----------------------------
```

- Give yourself a plenty of time (to get to the testing center)
  - Speaking test will usually comes after the other part of the test

- Make sure to bring your ID (and maybe your passport)

- An examiner will come and get (collect) you
  - When the examiner comes and gets you and you're walking together to the
    speaking test room, Don't suck up[^1] to them. Be very friendly. But don't try
    to make small talk at this stage. You can't impress the examiner here.
    impress them in the actual test. Certainly respond to them if they ask you
    any questions.

[^1]: You say that someone is sucking up to a person in authority when you do
    not like the fact that they are trying to please the person because of the
    person's position. (INFORMAL)

\newpage

## During Your Speaking Test, Part One (Small Talk) -- (4-5 min)

At this point, when you're sitting, the examiner will ask to see your passport
and confirm some details with you.

Then _part 1_ of the speaking test will begin with some pretty straightforward questions that you can think of as __small talk__.


> Do you live in an apartment or a house?

> Are you a student? Or do you work?


Then the questions will suddenly change direction. The examiner will say: let's talk about _art_ (or _rain_, or _computers_). Or let's talk about any of the following:

```
Birthdays                Hobbies                   Family

Childhood                Internet                  Friends

Daily routines           Music                     Flowers

Dictionaries             Neighbous                 Food

Evenings                 Newspapers                Going out

Happiness                Transport                 Weather

pets                     Reading                   Shopping

Sport                    TV
```

And then the examiner will ask you pretty straightforward question about one of those topics where you need to __give your personal views and opinion__

\newpage

## Part 2: 2-Minute Talk - (3--4 minutes)

The examiner will hand you _a piece of paper and a pen_ and give you _a task card_ that looks like this:

```
      ----------------------------------------------------
       Describe a X you have recently used.

       You should say:
       - What the X is
       - What you used the X for
       - How often you use the X

       And explain what you like and dislike about the X.
      ----------------------------------------------------
```

The tasks card will include a _prompt_, _three dot points_, and _an additional sentence_. You will have __one minute__ to prepare to speak about the particular topic you are given.

There are four main topic categories that you might have to speak about in IELTS speaking part 2.

- People (e.g., _A friend_)
- Places (e.g., _A library_)
- Objects (e.g., _A gift_)
- Events (e.g., _A wedding_)

Out of these 4 large categories, you'll have talk about a specific topic.

- A PERSON
  - _OLD / YOUNG_
  - _FAMOUS_
  - _OCCUPATION_
  - _FAMILY_
  - _TEEN etc._

- A PLACE
  - _FUN_
  - _CROWDED_
  - _INTERESTING_
  - _COUNTRYSIDE_
  - _SOCIAL PLACE_
  - _HOUSE_
  - _COUNTRY_

- A PHYSICAL OBJECT
  - _BOOK_
  - _FILM_
  - _GIFT_
  - _DEVICE_
  - _BUSINESS_

- AN ABSTRACT OBJECT
  - _WEBSITE_
  - _WEATHER_
  - _PROFESSION_
  - _GOALS / DREAMS_
  - _LANGUAGE_
  - _HOLIDAY_
  - _ENVIRONMENT_

- A TIME
  - _HAPPY / SAD_
  - _BORED / EXCITED_
  - _PLEASED / DISAPPOINTED_
  - _HELP_
  - _ADVICE_
  - _GOOD NEWS_
  - _LOST / FOUND_
  - _LEARNED_
  - _REMEMBERED_

After you've done two minute talk, the examiner _might_ give you a couple of _follow up questions_.

\newpage

## Part 3: Deep Discussion - (4--5 minutes)

In this part of the test, you're going to have a __dialogue__ with the examiner, a back and forth conversation. The questions that the examiner will ask you will carry on from _the task card that you looked at in part 2_. For example, If you were asked about an _advertisement_ in your task card, you will now talk to the examiner more broadly about _advertising_. If in your task card you talked about a _teacher_, you will now talk more broadly about _education_.

This is where it gets a little bit more abstract. You might need to

- _define_,
- _explain_,
- _argue_,
- _list_,
- _classify_,
- _compare / contrast_,
- or _describe_,

something.

> __DEFINE__: _What is an advertisement?_
>
> __EXPLAIN__: _Why do you think advertising works?_
>
> __ARGUE__: _Do you think TV ads or internet ads are more effective?_
>
> __LIST__: _What types of advertisements are there?_
>
> __CLASSIFY__: _Are logos on clothes, such as a t-shirt, a form of advertisement?_
>
> __COMPARE / CONTRAST__: _How has advertising changed in the last few decades?_
>
> __DESCRIBE__: _What makes an effective advertisement?_

It's worth pointing out that in part 3, you're not giving answers. There's no incorrect or correct answers. You're being graded on your _language skills_.

## Scoring

As soon as you finish part 3, the examiner is actually going to give you your score. There's a certain way that IELTS examiner mark you which is based on 7 key factors:

1. __Fluency__
  - You speak with little or no hesitation and very few umm and ahhs. The
    words and the rules come to you effortlessly.
  Also you speak at a moderate pace, not too fast, not too slow.
2. __Coherence__
  - Your phrases, sentences or ideas flow _logically_ from one to the next.
3. Vocabulary range
  - You have a broad repertoire of words that you can use to express yourself
    clearly.
4. __Vocabulary precision,__
  - (word choice) You're using the right word, at the right time to make the
    right meaning. You might use a fancy word here and there if it works, but
    you are not using fancy words that don't work. Always focus on _clarity_.
5. __Grammatical range__
  - You use a variety of different sentence types. For example, some complex,
    and compound complex, maybe a question, maybe a conditional sentence etc.
6. __Grammatical accuracy__
  - You get your verb tenses or propositions right. You get your question or negative sentence right.
7. __Pronunciation__
  - You can make all of the 44 individual sounds of English (the p, m, d etc.) as well as the combined sounds (the constant clusters like _spr_, _sm_, _sl_)
